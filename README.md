# Quantum Phase Estimation
From Wikipedia:

"The Quantum phase estimation algorithm (also referred to as quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm), is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. More precisely, given a unitary matrix {\displaystyle U}U and a quantum state {\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }|\psi \rangle  such that {\displaystyle U|\psi \rangle =e^{2\pi i\theta }|\psi \rangle }{\displaystyle U|\psi \rangle =e^{2\pi i\theta }|\psi \rangle }, the algorithm estimates the value of {\displaystyle \theta }\theta  with high probability within additive error {\displaystyle \varepsilon }\varepsilon , using {\displaystyle O(\log(1/\varepsilon ))}O(\log(1/\varepsilon )) qubits (without counting the ones used to encode the eigenvector state) and {\displaystyle O(1/\varepsilon )}{\displaystyle O(1/\varepsilon )} controlled-U operations.

Phase estimation is frequently used as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm[1]:131 and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations."
