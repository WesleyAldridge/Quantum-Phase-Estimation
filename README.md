# Quantum Phase Estimation

From Wikipedia:
"The Quantum phase estimation algorithm (also referred to as quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm), is a quantum algorithm to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. [...] Phase estimation is frequently used as a subroutine in other quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations."
